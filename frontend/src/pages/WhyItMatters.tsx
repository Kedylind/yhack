                Someone we love lost a pregnancy. There are no words that fix that. There is only grief, and time, and
                the people who show up when the world goes quiet.
              </p>
              <p>
                She did what any of us would do. She went where her doctors sent her, where she could get care quickly,
                where she felt safe. She was insured. She believed that meant she would not have to carry the full weight
                of the hospital bill on her own. She was already carrying enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then the envelope came. The total was{' '}
                <span className="font-semibold tabular-nums text-foreground">$59,409.98</span>. Not a typo. Not a mistake
                she could laugh off. A number that sat on the kitchen table like a second trauma.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her plan did not step in the way she had been led to expect. The insurer argued she could have gone
                somewhere cheaper, as if grief came with a spreadsheet, as if anyone in that moment should have been
                comparison shopping between hospitals. They used price as a reason to say no. She had never seen those
                prices before she needed care. How was she supposed to choose what she could not see?

              <p className="text-foreground">
                That bill is why we are building this. The system tells you to shop for care, then hides the price until
                after you are on the hook. We refuse to accept that as normal. Our job is to put real out-of-pocket
                estimates in front of people while they can still choose, not buried in files meant for regulators. We
                cannot change her past. We can make sure the next family sees the number before they walk in the door.

          A short story: costs moved to you before clarity moved with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employers and insurers held down premiums partly by raising deductibles and cost sharing. On paper you are
          covered. In practice you often pay thousands out of pocket before your plan behaves like full insurance. The
          fair next step would be obvious prices and accurate networks. Instead, many patients still get a bill they did
          not see coming, or they avoid care because they cannot guess what is safe to spend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawmakers required hospitals and payers to publish data. That helped researchers and regulators. It did not by
          itself give you a single screen that says, for your plan and your procedure, what you will owe at this hospital
          versus that one. Raw files are not a shopping experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-medium text-foreground">What we are building toward</span> is the missing layer: your
          coverage and real negotiated rates turned into estimates you can use before you book, so comparison is
          possible without a finance degree or hours on the phone.
